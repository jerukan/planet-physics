what utter garbage

This branch is specifically for my computer science project, where I have to devolve the code from kotlin to java

Ew

All the source files are found in core/src/io/github/jerukan

The sorting algorithm for the requirement is located in util/Functions.java. It's never used but it's there for the requirement, and trust me it works.

The important code snippets are mostly found on my website for the project. Of those not shown, these are the important ones:

- rendering/camera/GenericCamera.java
- ui/UIManager.java
- util/CameraInput.java
